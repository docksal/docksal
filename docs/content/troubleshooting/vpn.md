## Using Docksal with VPNs

Some VPNs are configured to intercept and re-route all traffic (let's call them "greedy"), thus breaking 
access to the 192.168.64.100 IP that Docksal is using. Attempting to change network routing while connected to
a greedy VPN will usually result in VPN dropping the connection. Enterprise security at work here.

The one thing VPNs cannot do though, is mess with the hosts loopback interface (127.0.0.1). That's how your 
traditional web server is not affected by a greedy VPN connection - it just binds to 127.0.0.1:80 (or more 
likely to 0.0.0.0:80 - port 80 on all network interfaces).

Binding to 0.0.0.0:80 can be achieved with Docksal like this:
```
fin config set --global DOCKSAL_VHOST_PROXY_IP=0.0.0.0
fin system reset vhost-proxy
```
You can then access http://localhost (or https://127.0.0.1) and see the "Project missing" page from Docksal's
vhost-proxy container.

Now, how do you get http://myproject.docksal working in this setup? <anything>.docksal resolves to 192.168.64.100 by default, and that won't work while connected to a greedy VPN.

For now, you will have to manually add an DNS override in your hosts file, e.g.:
```
127.0.0.1 myproject.docksal
```

Test it with a ping:
```
$ ping myproject.docksal
PING myproject.docksal (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.048 ms
```

The approach mentioned above is only possible on Linux or Docker Desktop (Mac and Windows). It won't work when using 
Docksal with VirtualBox.
