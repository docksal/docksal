In certain cases you may want to share or expose you local web server on the internet (e.g., share access with a teammate or customer to demonstrate the work or discuss the progress). Working with external web services that expect a callback URL is also generally not possible with a local environment.


## ngrok

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) creates a tunnel from the public internet `http://<subdomain>.ngrok.io` to a port on your local machine.
You can share the auto-generated URL with anyone to give them access to your local development environment. 
ngrok also has a web UI with an inspector for the HTTP traffic flowing over the tunnel.


## Usage

Inside the project folder run:

```bash
fin share
```

You will see a console output from the `ngrok` container.  
Use `*.ngrok.io` web address displayed there to share your project with others:

Use `Ctrl+C` to stop ngrok and sharing.

To access ngrok web UI, open another console window and run:

```bash
fin docker ps --format "{{.Names}} {{.Ports}}" | grep ngrok
```

In the output, look for the port number assigned to the container:

```bash
$ fin docker ps --format "{{.Names}} {{.Ports}}" | grep ngrok

project_web_1_ngrok 0.0.0.0:32769->4040/tcp
``` 

Access ngrok web UI at `http://192.168.64.100:32769`


## Overriding Default Host Value

The default `HOST` header value (passed to the web container) can be overridden using `--host-header` option.
This can be useful to share a specific site in a Drupal multi-site project.

```bash
fin share --host-header=example.com
```


## Additional ngrok Configuration

Additionally, you can specify one of several environment variables to configure your ngrok tunnel. These can be configured using an option as part of the `fin share` command or
can either be stored in `$HOME/.dockal/docksal.env` or at the project level within `.docksal/docksal.env`. Due to the nature and sensitivity of these variables, they
should be configured within `.docksal/docksal-local.env` and not committed to the repository.

Option | Variable | Purpose
-------|----------|--------
`--auth=XXXXX` | NGROK_AUTH | Authentication key for your ngrok account. This is needed for custom subdomains, custom domains, and HTTP authentication.
`--hostname=example.com` | NGROK_HOSTNAME | Paying ngrok customers can specify a custom domain. Only one subdomain or domain can be specified, with the domain taking priority.
`--subdomain=test` | NGROK_SUBDOMAIN | Name of the custom subdomain to use for your tunnel. You must also provide the authentication token.
`--username=username` | NGROK_USERNAME | Username to use for HTTP authentication on the tunnel. You must also specify an authentication token.
`--password=password` | NGROK_PASSWORD | Password to use for HTTP authentication on the tunnel. You must also specify an authentication token.
`--protocol=UDP` | NGROK_PROTOCOL | Can either be `HTTP` or `TCP`, and it defaults to `HTTP` if not specified. If set to `TCP`, ngrok will allocate a port instead of a subdomain and proxy TCP requests directly to your application.
`--port=8000` | NGROK_PORT | Port to expose (defaults to `80` for `HTTP` protocol).
`--region=us` | NGROK_REGION | Location of the ngrok tunnel server; can be `us` (United States, default), `eu` (Europe), `ap` (Asia/Pacific) or `au` (Australia)
`--debug` | NGROK_DEBUG | To debug the connection and see a more detailed log set this to 1
`--host-header=test.example.docksal` | NGROK_HEADER | Set Host Header. Set to the domain that should be passed through to the host.


## Configuration File

If ngrok is being used often with the same settings, you can consolidate your commands into an official ngrok config file. Copy the example config file from the [Docksal project repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docksal/docksal/develop/examples/.docksal/etc/ngrok/ngrok.yml) into your project repo as `.docksal/etc/ngrok/ngrok.yml`. For more details on the configuration file and configuration options, view the [ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs#config).

Note: It is also possible to add/override these values via `.docksal/etc/ngrok/ngrok-local.yml` at the project level. Keep in mind, `.docksal/etc/ngrok/ngrok.yml` is a shared configuration file and should be committed to git. `.docksal/etc/ngrok/ngrok-local.yml`, on the other hand, can be used for local overrides and should be excluded from git. As such, it is best to use `.docksal/etc/ngrok/ngrok-local.yml` for any personal details configured at the project level.

If you use the config file, all command line flags will be disregarded.

### Tunneling to multiple project sites

1. Add the following to `.docksal/etc/ngrok/ngrok-local.yml` to setup tunnels to multiple sites running in the same project:

    ```yaml
    authtoken: scrubbed
    tunnels:
      site1:
        addr: project_web_1.project_default:80
        proto: http
        host_header: site1.projecthost.docksal
        hostname: site1.ngrok.customdomain.com
      site2:
        addr: project_web_1.project_default:80
        proto: http
        host_header: site2.projecthost.docksal
        hostname: site2.ngrok.customdomain.com
      site3:
        addr: project_web_1.project_default:80
        proto: http
        host_header: site3.projecthost.docksal
        hostname: site3.ngrok.customdomain.com
      site4:
        addr: project_web_1.project_default:80
        proto: http
        host_header: site4.projecthost.docksal
        hostname: site4.ngrok.customdomain.com
    ```

2. Run `fin share` to start ngrok and open the tunnels. It will automatically use the configuration file above.

In the above example a wildcard domain is used. In this example that is `*.ngrok.customdomain.com`. Add this as a CNAME DNS entry pointed to the designated ngrok host assigned to it in your dashboard. Additional documentation about adding a wildcard domain to your account can be found at https://ngrok.com/docs#wildcard.

{{% notice info %}}
The above example leverages a Business account plan with ngrok, which allows for wildcard domains, multiple open tunnels and custom hostname/subdomains. See plans and pricing at https://ngrok.com/pricing.
