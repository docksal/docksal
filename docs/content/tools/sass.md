Cli container already contains `ruby`, `bundler`.

## Create Gemfile in Theme Folder

Example:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem 'sass', '~>3.4.0'
gem 'compass'
gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~>3.2.0'
```

## Install Tools

**Every developer runs `bundle install` to pull necessary gem dependencies**

This command should be run in the folder with Gemfile:

```bash
fin exec bundle install
```

Two folders (`.bundle`, `.bundler`) and a file (`Gemfile.lock`) will be created.
Please add these directories (`.bundle`/`.bundler`) to your `.gitignore` file.

## Compile SASS

Run in the theme folder:

```bash
fin exec bundle exec compass compile
```

This is important not run `compass compile` directly, but run it via `bundle exec` so that proper gem versions were used (defined in the Gemfile).

## Compass Watcher

You can run watcher to keep your CSS files up to date as changes are made:

```bash
fin exec bundle exec compass watch --poll
```
