# Docksal

Docker and Docker Compose based environments for web development.

    Docksal is still under active development. Breaking changes and outdated docs are very possible.
    We plan to have a 1.0 Release Candidate in November 2016.  
    Please help us by testing, submitting issues and PRs. Thanks!


## Examples of Docksal powered projects

Running a complete LAMP stack for Drupal, WordPress or a pure HTML/PHP base website is two commands away!<sup>*</sup>

```
git clone <sample-project-repo>
fin init
```

Try one of the preconfigured projects:

- [Drupal 7 sample project](https://github.com/docksal/drupal7)  
- [Drupal 8 sample project](https://github.com/docksal/drupal8)  
- [WordPress sample project](https://github.com/docksal/wordpress)

<sup>*</sup>Once you are done with a one-time [Docksal environment setup](env-setup.md)


<a name="setup"></a>
## Setup

Please review [system requirements](system-requirements.md) before proceeding with the setup.

1) [Docksal environment setup](env-setup.md)
    
    This is done **one time per host** and should be performed by everyone.

2) [Configure a project to use Docksal](project-setup.md)

    This is done **one time per project** and should be performed by the project TL.
