# Docksal

Docker and Docker Compose based environments for web development.

    Docksal is still under active development. Breaking changes and outdated docs are very possible.
    Please help us by testing, submitting issues and PRs. Thanks!


## Examples of preconfigured Docksal powered projects

Running a complete LAMP stack for Drupal, WordPress or a pure HTML/PHP base website is two commands away!<sup>*</sup>

```
git clone <sample-project-repo>
fin init
```

Try one of the preconfigured projects:

- [Drupal 7 sample project](https://github.com/docksal/drupal7)
- [Drupal 8 sample project](https://github.com/docksal/drupal8)
- [WordPress sample project](https://github.com/docksal/wordpress)

<sup>*</sup>Once you are done with a one-time [Docksal environment setup](/docs/env-setup.md)


<a name="setup"></a>
## Setup

Please review [system requirements](/docs/system-requirements.md) before proceeding with the setup.

1. [Docksal environment setup](/docs/env-setup.md)

    This is done **one time per host** and should be performed by everyone.

2. [Configure a project to use Docksal](/docs/project-setup.md)

    This is done **one time per project** and should be performed by the project TL.
