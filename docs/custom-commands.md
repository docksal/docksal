# Fin custom commands

It is possible to extend fin with custom commands (per project).

1) Create a custom command

File `[project dir]/.docksal/commands/updb` (Notice **no extension**. Script name should match command name)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
    
## Runs drush updb
##
## Usage: fin updb [params to passthrough]
 
fin drush updb $1
```

2) Set executable bit: `chmod +x .docksal/commands/updb`  
3) Use as regular fin command: `fin updb`  
4) Passing parameters also works: `fin updb -y`  
5) See command description in `fin help` and command full help via `fin help updb` 

## Available variables

These environment variables are available for use inside you custom command scripts:

* `PROJECT_ROOT` - absolute path to project folder.  
* `DOCROOT` - relative path to the project's document root, from within the project directory.
* `APACHE_DOCUMENTROOT` - absolute path to the document root, as seen by the web container. For 
example, `/var/www/docroot`.

Example `init` command for a Drupal website using drush to automate the install:  

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Start containers
fin up
# Install site
fin drush site-install -y --site-name="My Drupal site"
# Get login link
cd docroot 2>dev/null 
fin drush uli
```

## Documenting custom command

Fin looks for lines starting with `##` for command documentation. 

```bash
## Custom command description
## Usage: fin mycommand [--force]
## Parameters:
## --force Try really hard
```

Fin will output first line of custom command documentation as a short decription in `fin help`.  
Rest of lines will be available as advanced help via `fin help command_name`

See an example of command documentation in the phpcs command (examples/.docksal/commands/phpcs located in the [Docksal project](https://github.com/docksal/docksal).)

## Global custom commands

Put your command in `~/.docksal/commands` and it will be accessible globally.  
Useful for tedious tasks that you need in every project.

## Advanced use

It is not imperative to use bash. You can use any interpreter for your custom command scripts

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print "Custom python command!"
```

```node
#!/usr/bin/env node
/*
## Custom node command description
*/
console.log("Custom NodeJS command!")
```
