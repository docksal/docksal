# Drupal settings

Below you will find instructions on configuring your Drupal project to work with Docksal.
Some settings are required; others are optional or enhancements. Please review carefully.

<a name="db"></a>
# DB connection settings (**required**)

Containers do not have static IP addresses assigned.  DB connection settings can be obtained from the environment variables.

Below are sample settings for Drupal 7 and Drupal8.

**Drupal 7 and 8**

```php
# Docksal DB connection settings.
$databases['default']['default'] = array (
  'database' => 'default',
  'username' => 'user',
  'password' => 'user',
  'host' => 'db',
  'driver' => 'mysql',
);
```

<a name="file-permissions"></a>
## File permissions fix (**required**)

To make sure files and folder generated by Drupal are writable add the following to your `setting.php` file.

**Drupal 7**

```php
# Workaround for permission issues with NFS shares in Vagrant
$conf['file_chmod_directory'] = 0777;
$conf['file_chmod_file'] = 0666;
```

**Drupal 8**

```php
# Workaround for permission issues with NFS shares in Vagrant
$settings['file_chmod_directory'] = 0777;
$settings['file_chmod_file'] = 0666;
```

You may also have to reset permissions on the existing files folder. 
The following command will recursively set folders to 777 (rwx) and files to 666 (rw).

```bash
chmod -R +rwX files
```

<a name="reverse-proxy"></a>
## Reverse proxy settings (**optional**)

In some cases you need to let Drupal know if HTTPS is used by client. Add the following lines to settings.php:

**Drupal 7**

```php
# Reverse proxy configuration (Docksal's vhost-proxy)
if (!drupal_is_cli()) {
  $conf['reverse_proxy'] = TRUE;
  $conf['reverse_proxy_addresses'] = array($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
  // HTTPS behind reverse-proxy
  if (
    isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] == 'https' &&
    !empty($conf['reverse_proxy']) && in_array($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $conf['reverse_proxy_addresses'])
  ) {
    $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';
    // This is hardcoded because there is no header specifying the original port.
    $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] = 443;
  }
}
```

**Drupal 8**

```php
# Reverse proxy configuration (Drude's vhost-proxy)
if (PHP_SAPI !== 'cli') {
  $settings['reverse_proxy'] = TRUE;
  $settings['reverse_proxy_addresses'] = array($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
  // HTTPS behind reverse-proxy
  if (
    isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] == 'https' &&
    !empty($settings['reverse_proxy']) && in_array($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $settings['reverse_proxy_addresses'])
  ) {
    $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';
    // This is hardcoded because there is no header specifying the original port.
    $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] = 443;
  }
}
```
