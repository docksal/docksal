# System requirements


## Hardware

### RAM

**8GB** (16GB if you keep lost of apps running) recommended for a comfortable work experience.  
By default Docker Machine uses 1Gb of RAM.

### CPU

Your CPU should support hardware **VT-x/AMD-V virtualization** (most modern CPUs) and it should be enabled in BIOS.


## Software

While Docker is supported natively on Linux, Mac and Windows users will need a VM layer to be able to run Docker containers.

There are two main options to get Docker Linux containers running on Mac or Windows:

1. Docker Machine + [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) 5.0+ (mature, battle proof)
2. Docker for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac)/[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows) (newer, experimental)

Please refer to the [setup instructions](/README.md#setup) for further steps.
