## Failed creating Docksal virtual machine

Mostly on Windows 7 but sometimes on other OS-s VirtualBox fails to create new virtual machine on the first run. Errors might be very different but usually simply removing failed machine and trying again helps.

```
fin vm remove
fin vm start
```

## Error checking TLS connection (vm is not accessible)

```
Error checking TLS connection: Error checking and/or regenerating the certs: There was an error validating certificates for host "192.168.64.100:2376": dial tcp 192.168.64.100:2376: getsockopt: connection refused
You can attempt to regenerate them using 'docker-machine regenerate-certs [name]'.
Be advised that this will trigger a Docker daemon restart which will stop running containers.
```

#### Explanation

Sometimes docker-machine certificaties re-generation fails. 

#### Solution
Usually it is solved with `fin vm restart`.

If simple restart did not help try
```
fin docker-machine regenerate-certs -f
fin vm restart
```

However in rare cases this does not help too.
If that does not help either you will have to delete existing Docksal VM and re-create it.

1. `fin vm remove`
2. `fin vm start`


## Lack of memory

Composer on Drupal 8 projects might spawn this error:

```
The following exception is caused by a lack of memory and not having swap configured
Check https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#proc-open-fork-failed-errors for details
```

#### Explanation

Default Docksal virtual machine features 1GB (1024MB) of RAM. Drupal 8 tools sometimes require more that that.

#### Solution

Set bigger amount of RAM. For instance 2048 Mb
```
fin vm ram 2048
```

## Conflicting exports (files are not accessible)
```
 ERROR:  conflicting exports for /Users, 192.168.64.100
exports:11: export option conflict for /Users
-----------------
/Users 192.168.64.100 -alldirs -mapall=0:0
# <ds-nfs docksal
/Users 192.168.64.100 -alldirs -mapall=501:20
# ds-nfs>
```

#### Explanation: a single directory can only be exported once. 

It can not be exported several times with different settings.
   
#### Solution
   
1) Remove conflicting export from `/etc/exports` (remove the one which is non-docksal) and save the file.  
2) `fin vm restart`

## Conflicting ports

```
Resetting Docksal services...
 * proxy
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity
on endpoint docksal-vhost-proxy (a7addf7797e6b0aec8e3e810c11775eb77508c9079e375c083b3650df2dff9a2):
Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:443: listen: address already in use.
```

#### Explanation: default Apache server

Usually happens on Linux because default Apache listens on `0.0.0.0:80` and `0.0.0.0:443`.
This prevents Docksal from running properly.

#### Solution

You either need to stop Apache or reconfigure it to listen on different ports (e.g. `8080` and `4433`) or
different host (e.g. `127.0.0.1:80` and `127.0.0.1:443`).


## Config permissions issue (vm does not start)

```
open /Users/John.Doe/.docker/machine/machines/docksal/config.json: permission denied
```

####  Explanation
You have created Docksal machine as root user (maybe using sudo). 
This is not recommended in particular because of problems like this.

#### Solution
Re-create vm as a regular user

1. `sudo fin vm remove`
2. `fin vm start`

## Multiple host-only adapters (vm is not created)

```
Error with pre-create check: "VirtualBox is configured with multiple host-only adapters with the same IP \"192.168.64.1\". Please remove one."
```

1. Open VirtulBox UI
2. Open Preferences > Network tab
3. Click "Host-only Netwirks" tab
4. Click through adapters in list and delete the ones with `192.168.64.1` IP
