# Docksal environment setup

**This is a one time setup.**  
Once you have a working Docksal environment in place, you can use it for all Docksal powered projects.

## Windows only

On Windows you will need a Linux-type shell.

Install [Babun](http://babun.github.io/) before proceeding and run all commands in it.  
Instructions were not tested with other shells on Windows.

Babun should be installed and run **as a regular user (do not use admin command prompt).**

## Installation

1. (**Mac/Win**) Install [VirtualBox 5.1.2 Mac](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.2/VirtualBox-5.1.2-108956-OSX.dmg)/[VirtualBox 5.1.2 Win](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.2/VirtualBox-5.1.2-108956-Win.exe) (**Please note that specific version is important.** If you're using different version you can experience unforeseen bugs. fin will notify you about a need to update your VirtualBox version in future.
2. Install/update `fin`

    ```
    sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docksal/docksal/develop/bin/fin -o /usr/local/bin/fin && \
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fin
    ```

3. Install/update tools and configurations

    ```
    fin update
    ```
4. (**Mac/Win**) Create and start vm

    ```
    fin vm start
    ```

    [Help, VM did not start!](/docs/troubleshooting.md#failed-creating-docksal-virtual-machine)

5. Congratulations! You are done with one time environment installation. Now you can [configure your project](/docs/project-setup.md) to use Docksal or create a new pre-configured Drupal or Wordpress project with `fin create-site`.

## Using Docker for Mac/Windows instead of VirtualBox

Docker for Mac/Windows support is experimental and is not recommended for regular use due to low filesystem performance. Please report any issues in the [issue queue](https://github.com/docksal/docksal/issues)

#### Switching to native Docker application for Mac/Window

1. Install Docker for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows)  
2. Install `fin` and run `fin update` (unless already installed)

    ```
    sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docksal/docksal/develop/bin/fin -o /usr/local/bin/fin && \
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fin
    fin update
    ```

3. Run `export DOCKER_NATIVE=1` in your terminal

    This applies to a single terminal tab/session and has to be repeated for new ones).
    All further `fin` commands should be run within the same terminal tab/session. 

4. Run `fin docker info | grep "Kernel Version"`

    If you see something like `Kernel Version: 4.4.27-moby` in the output, 
    then `fin` was able to communicate with your Docker for Mac/Windows instance.

5. Run `fin reset system` 

#### Switching back to VirtualBox

1. `unset DOCKER_NATIVE`
2. `fin reset system`

    This will reset system services and update DNS resolution for .docksal domains (Mac)

3. Run `fin docker info | grep "Kernel Version"`

    `Kernel Version: 4.4.27-boot2docker` means you switched back to the VirtualBox VM (TinyCore, boot2docker)
    `Kernel Version: 4.4.27-moby` means you are still using Docker for Mac/Windows VM (Alpine Linux Moby)
