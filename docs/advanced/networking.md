## Exposing container ports

By default, container ports are not accessible outside of Docker. Other containers can work with them, but you can't access them from your host.

```
$ fin ps
     Name                   Command               State        Ports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
netscout_cli_1   /opt/startup.sh gosu root  ...   Up      22/tcp, 9000/tcp
netscout_db_1    /entrypoint.sh mysqld            Up      3306/tcp
netscout_web_1   /opt/startup.sh apache2 -D ...   Up      443/tcp, 80/tcp
```

The container ports in the right column are exposed to Docker. Follow the steps below to expose any of these ports to the host.

**1.** Create `docksal-local.yml`

This is recommended for creating local overrides instead of modifying `docksal.yml` directly.

**2.** Put the following contents into `docksal-local.yml`.

This will instruct Docker to export port `22` of the `cli` service as port `2222` on your host.

```yaml
version: "2"
  services:
    cli:
      ports:
        - "2222:22"
```

**Note the quotes.** Yaml interprets some numbers with a colon as base64 numbers, so you need quotes here.

**3.** Run `fin project start` to apply the new configuration.

**4.** Now you can see that your port is exposed.

Note `0.0.0.0:2222` is pointing to `22`.

```
$ fin ps
     Name                   Command               State            Ports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
netscout_cli_1   /opt/startup.sh gosu root  ...   Up      0.0.0.0:2222->22/tcp, 9000/tcp
netscout_db_1    /entrypoint.sh mysqld            Up      3306/tcp
netscout_web_1   /opt/startup.sh apache2 -D ...   Up      443/tcp, 80/tcp
```
