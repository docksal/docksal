# Stack configuration

It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the [Docksal stack](../advanced/stack.md) documentation before reading 
this manual. You should understand what project containers are and which project containers exist by default.

## Basics

Docksal relies on [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to launch groups of related containers.
The yml files you use are [Compose Files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/). 
Please read the documentation to understand their main sections.

!!! danger "REMEMBER DOCKSAL REQUIREMENTS"
    Some containers and their parameters are required for Docksal to work properly. 
    **Please see [Don't break your Docksal setup!](#warning) section.**

You have to run `fin project start` (`fin p start` for short) to apply configuration changes.
If you remove services or volumes you have to remove them with `fin project rm [service]`.

## Project configuration files
<a name="docksal-yml"></a>
### docksal.yml

`docksal.yml` is a [Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).
It's the main configuration file for a project and controls its the settings for each service. Use it to
modify settings that are needed for anyone that uses your project.

If you don't have this file in your project folder, fin will load the [default stack](#default-configurations), 
this way providing a zero-configuration setup.

For more details on its role check [loading order](#loading-order).

<a name="docksal-env"></a>
### docksal.env

`docksal.env` is an [Environment file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/).

It is used to override of some of the default environment variables, without the need for
a full `docksal.yml` file (for example, to override `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`) or to provide additional environment
variables for your automation scripts (see [custom commands](../fin/custom-commands.md).)

<a name="docksal-local"></a>
### docksal-local.yml, docksal-local.env

`docksal-local.yml` and `docksal-local.env` are used for additional customizations that happen after the main files 
are loaded. See [loading order](#loading-order). A good example of their use is [exposing custom port](../advanced/networking.md#expose-port) 
or switching PHP versions.

These files are intended for local overrides. They should be added to `.gitignore` and never committed into a project 
repo. You can always include an example file in the repo, e.g. `example.docksal-local.env` and instruct users to copy 
it and adjust as necessary.

<a name="default-configurations"></a>
## Default stacks

Docksal ships with a set of default configurations (stacks), which are `yml` files stored in `$HOME/.docksal/stacks/`.
These files are a good reference, when you begin creating a custom project configuration.

| File name                  | Description |
|----------------------------|:------------|
| `volumes-*.yml`            | Different bindings for Docker volumes. The default is `volume-bind.yml`. Always used for binding volumes.  
| `services.yml`             | Contains default service descriptions. Used for zero-configuration. |
| `stack-default.yml`        | The default stack with 3 services that inherits `services.yml`. Used for zero-configuration. |
| `stack-default-static.yml` | Same configuration as `stack-default.yml` but does not inherit `services.yml`|
| `stack-acquia.yml`         | Acquia-like stack with Solr, Varnish and memcached|

!!! warning "DO NOT CHANGE DEFAULT STACKS!"
    Do not change or customize existing default stacks.  
    Use the `.docksal` folder in your project to customize the project configuration.

<a name="loading-order"></a>
## Configuration files loading order

With this swarm of configuration files Docksal lets you configure a project in a way that works for you and your team. 
Just like Bash configuration files (/etc/profile, bashrc, bash_profile, bash_logout), they give the flexibility to 
configure a Docksal project in dozens of ways.

`fin` loads files in a certain order. Files loaded later override settings from the files loaded earlier. 
The list below goes from the earliest to the latest in this queue.

Loading order:

1. `$HOME/.docksal/stacks/volumes-*.yml` - only `volumes-bind.yml` loads at the moment ([volumes in Docksal](../advanced/volumes.md).)
2. `$HOME/.docksal/stacks/stack-*.yml` - only loads if there is no `docksal.yml` in the project or if forced by settings the `DOCKSAL_STACK` variable in `docksal.env`.
3. `docksal.yml` - extends the stack if `DOCKSAL_STACK` is set in `docksal.env` or completely overrides it otherwise.
4. `docksal.env` - sets or modifies environment variables.
5. `docksal-local.yml` - extends the loaded stack or `docksal.yml`.
6. `docksal-local.env` - sets or modifies environment variables set previously.

To see the files loaded for a particular project run `fin config show`.

<a name="zero-configuration"></a>
## Zero-configuration

You can simply create a `.docksal` folder in your project root and run `fin project start` (`fin start` for short).
The default stack (`$HOME/.docksal/stacks/stack-default.yml`) will be loaded and used to create containers in this case.

This is a great way to start developing a new project. This approach can also be used on a permanent basis, 
if your needs are simple. `stack-default.yml` extends the configuration from `services.yml`, 
so you'll be getting the latest stack versions with every Docksal update.

### Zero-configuration stacks

You can switch between pre-created zero-configuration stacks by adding the following line to your `docksal.env` file 
and running `fin project reset`.

```
DOCKSAL_STACK="acquia"
```

The following stacks are available:

- `default` - web, db, cli (assumed, when none specified.)
- `acquia` - web, db, cli, varnish, memcached, solr (used specifically for [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) hosted projects.)

<a name="custom-configuration"></a>
## Custom configuration

Custom configurations are useful when you have a larger or more complex project. One where a CI server is involved 
or many people are on a project team, and you have to be careful about maintaining software versions. 
Having a custom configuration will protect your project from the updates in `services.yml` when you update Docksal.

```bash
fin config generate
```

This command will create `docksal.yml` by copying `stack-default-static.yml` into the project directory.
This file has a fully independent description of services, so future changes to the default stack(s) will no longer 
affect the project configuration. This also means that future Docksal updates, bringing new features and changes, 
will not automatically apply. You might need to re-generate your static configuration or append those changes manually 
in `docksal.yml`.

<a name="warning"></a>
### Don't break your Docksal setup! List of must have values.

!!! important "REQUIREMENTS"
    Some must have values for your Docksal stack to work properly.

There are some values that are not required for docker-compose to work but are required for your Docksal stack to function.

#### web

In the `web` service there are settings defined in the `volumes`, `labels`, `environment` and `depends_on` sections. 
You should not remove or change these values.

```yaml
  web:
    volumes:
      # Project root volume
      - project_root:/var/www:ro,nocopy
    labels:
      - io.docksal.virtual-host=${VIRTUAL_HOST},*.${VIRTUAL_HOST}
      - io.docksal.project-root=${PROJECT_ROOT}
    environment:
      - APACHE_DOCUMENTROOT=/var/www/${DOCROOT:-docroot}
    # cli has to be up before web
    depends_on:
      - cli
```

#### cli

In the `cli` service there is the `volumes` section. You should not remove or change these volumes.

```yaml
  cli:
    volumes:
      # Project root volume
      - project_root:/var/www:rw,nocopy
      # Shared ssh-agent socket
      - docksal_ssh_agent:/.ssh-agent:ro
```

<a name="checking"></a>
## Checking project configuration

To review the configuration applied to your project run:

```bash
fin config show
```

It does not show the contents or the configuration files directly. Instead, it compiles them together and outputs 
the resulting configuration. Some important environment variables are listed at the top.  

The `COMPOSE_FILE` section displays files that were used to produce this configuration. 
See [configuration files load order](#loading-order) for more information on how config files are loaded and merged.

A sample output from `fin config show`:

```
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME: myproject
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME_SAFE: myproject

## Switching PHP versions

The PHP version is defined by the `cli` service. The default image used is `docksal/cli:1.3-php7` which uses PHP 7.

A service image name consists of two parts: a docker image name and a tag.
Here `docksal/cli` is the name of the docker image, while `1.2-php7` is the image tag.

To switch PHP versions you have to change the image used for the `cli` service to your desired one.

[How to find out all supported PHP versions?](#docksal-images)

### Extend or modify config with `docksal-local.yml` or `docksal.yml`

When using zero-configuration (or any other) the service image can be overridden in `docksal-local.yml`.

The same technique is **applicable to `dosksal.yml` if `DOCKSAL_STACK` is set in `docksal.env`**. In this case,
`docksal.yml` will extend/modify the stack configuration defined in `DOCKSAL_STACK` instead of overriding it.

To switch the PHP version override the `image` value for the `cli` service.

For example, in `docksal-local.yml` or `docksal.yml`:

```yaml
version: "2.1"

services:
  cli:
    image: docksal/cli:1.3-php5
```

`docksal-local.yml` will append or modify the configuration that was loaded before it, regardless of whether it was 
`stack-default.yml` or `docksal.yml`.

`docksal.yml` will append or modify the configuration only if `DOCKSAL_STACK` is set in `docksal.env`.

### Override config with `docksal.yml`

When not using a predefined stack (`docksal.yml` is present and `DOCKSAL_STACK` is not set in `docksal.env`), 
you are in control of everything. In this case the stack configuration is not inherited from 
`services.yml` (`$HOME/.docksal/services.yml`), so you must fully describe the `cli` service in the project's `docksal.yml`.

An example section of a `docksal.yml` file that describes the `cli` service and overrides the PHP version:

```yaml
services:
  cli:
    hostname: cli
    image: docksal/cli:1.3-php5
    volumes:
    - docksal_ssh_agent:/.ssh-agent:ro
    - project_root:/var/www:rw,nocopy
```

Note, that when not using a predefined stack, you must fully describe all other services (`web`, `db`, etc.) as well.

<a name="mysql-version"></a>
## Switching MySQL versions

Switching MySQL versions is performed in the same way as the PHP version switch. 
Instead of the `cli` service image you will be modifying the `db` service image.

<a name="docksal-images"></a>
## Docksal images and versions

To see all Docker Hub images produced and supported by Docksal team run:

```bash
fin image registry
```

To get all tags of a certain image provide its name with the same command. E.g.:

```bash
fin image registry docksal/db
```

## Automate the initialization process

This is optional, but highly recommended.

Site provisioning can be automated via a [custom command](../fin/custom-commands.md).
E.g. `fin init`, which will call `.docksal/commands/init`. Put project specific initialization tasks there, like:

- initialize the Docksal configuration.
- import databases or perform a site install.
- compile SASS.
- run DB updates, special commands, etc.
- run Behat tests.

For a working example of a Docksal powered project with `fin init` take a look at:

- [Drupal 7 sample project](https://github.com/docksal/drupal7)
- [Drupal 8 sample project](https://github.com/docksal/drupal8)
- [WordPress sample project](https://github.com/docksal/wordpress)
