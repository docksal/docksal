# Docksal VirtualBox VM configuration

These instructions are only applicable to macOS and Windows.

## Set Docksal's Virtualbox VM memory (RAM)

`fin vm ram` - will show the current memory size

For hosts with limited RAM (less than 8GB) it may be necessary to limit the VM memory to 1GB:

`fin vm ram 1024` - will set the VM memory to 1024MB

1GB of RAM provides enough memory to run 2 basic LAMP stacks at the same time.

When working with multiple projects, it is best to limit the number of active projects to 1 or 2. 
Trying to launch more than 2 at the same time may result in unpredictable issues.

Use `fin stop --all` to stop all projects, then `fin project start` to restart the one you plan to work with.

## Increasing Docksal's Virtualbox VM disk size (HDD)

### With losing current containers and their data

Involves removing current VM. Your files will not be deleted but databases will need to be re-imported, containers' images will be re-downloaded.

1. `fin vm remove`
2. `VBOX_HDD=80000 fin vm start`

`VBOX_HDD` is disk size in Megabytes. Default is `50000`.

### Without losing current containers and data

There is no good way to automate this.
