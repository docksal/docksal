## Better than VMs

"I love my Vagrant box. Why would I want to switch to a Docker based solution?"  

Containers are just [better than VMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jev2EW2hzdY): 
smaller, faster, portable, and more efficient across the board.

Unified environment across the team, regardless of the OS.

Unprecedented ability to automate routine tasks, slashing the time to on-board new people.
