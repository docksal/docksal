Docker powered environments for web development on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Running Drupal, Wordpress, Magento, Laravel, Symfony, Backdrop, Grav, Hugo, Gatsby, 
and others can be one step away with ready to use boilerplates.

```
fin project create
```

Create your [custom automation](https://docs.docksal.io/en/master/fin/custom-commands/) in Bash, PHP or Node 
to spin up your project anywhere where Docksal is with a single command, or to automate regular tasks. Unified
environment ensures that your automation will work for everyone in your team.

## Better than VMs

"I love my Vagrant box. Why would I want to switch to a Docker based solution?"  

Containers are just [better than VMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jev2EW2hzdY): 
smaller, faster, portable, and more efficient across the board.

Unified environment across the team, regardless of the OS.

Unprecedented ability to automate routine tasks, slashing the time to on-board new people.
