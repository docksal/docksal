- fin v1.41.0
- docker/boot2docker v17.09.0-ce
- docker-compose v1.16.1
- docker-machine v0.13.0
- VirtualBox v5.1.28 (the latest boot2docker is using VirtualBox Guest Additions v5.1.28, so we stick with a matching version here as well)

### New Features

- `fin project` command subset replaces the old `fin start/stop/restart/rm` commands.

    The old commands are still supported to preserve compatibility.

- Docker for Mac: osxfs caching is automatically enabled to improve read performance. (#249, #397)
- Docker for Mac: [Unison file sync](http://docs.docksal.io/en/v1.6.0/advanced/volumes/#unison-volumes) support
- You can add environment dependent ENV and YML files based on `$DOCKSAL_ENVIRONMENT` variable, e.g., `docksal-myenv.yml`,
 that would only apply, if `DOCKSAL_ENVIRONMENT=myenv` (#383, #354). Official documentation is pending.
- New sample project repos and wizards: [Grav](https://github.com/docksal/example-grav), 
[Gatsby JS](https://github.com/docksal/example-gatsby) and [Laravel](https://github.com/docksal/example-laravel)
- New `vhosts` command to show all registered Docksal virtual hosts

### Changes and improvements

- Docker for Mac/Win: networking setup is now aligned with the VirtualBox mode and Linux:

```
  192.168.64.1 - host IP
  192.168.64.100 - Docksal IP
```

- Docker for Mac: Add ssh keys on up/restart/reset (#396)
- Docker for Mac/Win: Fixed xdebug settings. (#389, #393)
- Ubuntu 17.10: Install `ifupdown` and `resolvconf` if they are missing (#321)
- Ubuntu 17.10: Address slow fs performance with the `overlay2` storage driver (defaut in Docker for Mac/Win and Ubuntu 17.04+) by adding `/home/docker` volume in `cli` (#325)
- Addressed the DNS issue of corporate networks and VPN

    Added backup upstream DNS server for docksal-dns. This addresses cases when `DOCKSAL_DNS_UPSTREAM` is set to an internal IP (VPN/LAN) and becomes inaccessible when user disconnects from that network. `8.8.4.4` will now be used as a backup when DOCKSAL_DNS_UPSTREAM is not reachable.

- Exposed ngrok Web UI on a random port to make it accessible from the host  (#379)
- Project images are now auto-updated during overall update
- Show virtual host name after project start
- Allow installing Docksal addons from a non-default GitHub repo
- Allow any `exec_target` for addons and custom commands (#356).

    Requires that container specified as `exec_target` has `project_root` volume defined, just like cli:
    ```
        volumes:
          ## Project root volume
          - project_root:/var/www:rw,nocopy
    ```

- Fixed version comparison bug
- Fixed MySQL permissions and default db missing bugs in `fin db create` (#351, #371, #372)
- Fixed the bug that Virtualbox update breaks docker-machine upgrade and users need to run `fin update` twice. (#280)
- Fin will check that Docksal system services (`dns`, `vhost-proxy`, `ssh-agent`) are running and restart them otherwise
- Use `DOCKSAL_DNS_DOMAIN` variable value for default `VIRTUAL_HOST` (#390)
- Fix that system images were not updated during install in Docker for Mac/Win mode
- Ensure `~/.ssh` exists. This prevents errors for users with no ssh keys
- Increase CLI healthcheck wait timeout to 60 seconds for intensive operations during custom healthchecks

## 1.3.1 (2017-06-02)

### New software versions 
* **fin 1.10.0**

### Fixes and improvements

* Fix retrospective bug that was making `DOCKSAL_DNS2` value empty
* Fix permissions issues on Windows that were related to improper `uid`/`gid`
* Fix edge case with software versions comparison, that prevented software installations in some cases (#224)
* Refactored automatic DNS resolver configuration
  - Doing a DNS probe to make sure the upstream DNS server is reachable
  - Using `8.8.8.8` a the default upstream DNS on all platforms
  - `DOCKSAL_DNS_UPSTREAM` can be used to override the default upstream DNS server
  - Automatic DNS resolver can now be disabled via `DOCKSAL_NO_DNS_RESOLVER=true`
  - Set interface metric on Windows. This makes sure our VBox adapters is the first in the list and thus it's DNS server settings will be used by Windows
  - Adding configure_resolver "off" mode. This will revert resolver settings when the VM is stopped, killed, removed
  - Added a flag to control query logging in `docksal-dns`
  - Updated docs regarding the DNS resolver


## 1.3.0 (2017-05-16)

### New Features

* `*.docksal` domain resolver now works on Windows removing the need to edit the `hosts` file! 
* `fin db <command>` replaces all previously existing mysql related commands (`sqli` is now `db import` etc.). See `fin db help` for details. Old commands still work for compatibility.
* `fin vm hdd` - show VM hdd capacity and usage. `fin vm stats` will only show CPU and network stats now
* `fin hosts` - easily add or remove a host to/from OS-dependent `hosts` file (Relates to #113)
* Override VirtualBox HDD size during VM creation. Set `VBOX_HDD` environment variable to the desired size in megabytes. Default is `50000`. (see https://github.com/docksal/docksal/commit/d50e00367514f64ad0ae4421f6d08cc614d39e2e for details)

### Changes and improvements

* Windows SMB share creation and mount refactoring
    - Prefix Docksal SMB shares with `docksal-` to avoid conflicts with existing shares. Docksal share names on Windows will now look like `\\computer\docksal-c` instead of `\\computer\c` before. Should address file permissions issues some Windows users had had.
    - Domain name is now properly passed during shares mount. Should address share mount issues for domain users.
    - Mount SMB shares with `ntlmssp` or `ntlm` security options. Perform two attempts: use `ntlmssp` by default, use `ntlm` as a fallback. Should address issues for many users of corporate Windows laptops (#117)
    - Perform umount before mount in `smb_share_mount` to simplify debugging (e.g., `fin vm mount` to remount the share)
    - Allow overriding CIFS `sec` option by setting `SEC_SMB` environment variable. Useful for debugging or for edge cases when neither of existing options work. `SMB_SEC=ntlmv2 fin vm mount`. Also see [unix.stackexchange.com/questions/124342](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/124342/mount-error-13-permission-denied/124352#124352)
* Improve messaging to show when database dump is being imported from stdin 
* Fix automatic VirtualBox installation on Windows
* Docksal console desktop icon is deprecated. With the winpty improvements there is no need in this experimental console approach anymore.
* Import SSH keys during containers reset on Linux (#180)
* `vhost-proxy` and `dns` are now binding to `192.168.64.100` on all platforms. This should help to avoid conflicts with local web server instances (assuming they also don't bind to `0.0.0.0`, but use a specific IP instead (e.g., Apache on Linux can now run on `127.0.0.1` in parallel with Docksal)

### Documentation

* How to increase Docksal VirtualBox VM disk size 
* Drush site aliases documentation improvements
* New edge case in Troubleshooting: `FastCGI: incomplete headers`
* Updated "Working with multiple projects/domains"
* Added "Stats and analytics" section

  - Adds support for saving and loading Docksal system and project images (e.g., from a local drive).

- Soften Docker version requirements - allowing higher Docker versions, since Docker added backward API compatibility.
- `fin cleanup` is now executed on `fin update` to address weird cases when Docker is using outdated image versions. #155
- Added DNS settings for all services. Addresses the issue with containers not being able to resolve `.docksal` domains.

- Removed `VIRTUAL_HOST` env variable from stack files and docs. Starting with `docksal/vhost-proxy:1.0` the `io.docksal.virtual-host` label is used instead. The `VIRTUAL_HOST` env variable can still be used (for compatibility reasons).
