## Changes and improvements

- Basic automated test in example repos
- Removed old icon scripts on for Windows

# 1.4.0 (2017-08-03)

## Breaking changes

For custom configurations (using `docksal.yml`), if you are getting:

```bash
ERROR: Named volume "host_home:/.home:ro" is used in service "cli" but no declaration was found in the volumes section.
```

Remove `host_home:/.home:ro` from `docksal.yml` and do a `fin project start`.

## New Features

- Implemented a Docker healthcheck for cli
  - Requires docksal/cli v1.3.0+. Falls back to waiting for 10s for the container to become ready for older versions.
- Addons (experimental)
  - Ability to install and remove addons (custom commands) per project or globally from statically defined repo docksal/addons
- Prevent NFS conflicts on macOS. (#133)
  - `DOCKSAL_NFS_PATH` can be used to override Docksal projects folder which effectively serves as NFS mount point. 
- Added support for simple static site creation in `fin project create` (#177)
- Added custom commands to bash autocomplete (#232)
- `fin sql-import --progress`
  - `--progress` displays import progress using `pv` (if installed on the host)
- `fin build` - support for `docker-compose build` workflow
- Support for executing custom commands in `cli` instead of host
  - Add `#: exec_target = cli` in the header of the custom command to tell fin to execute the command within `cli` via `fin exec`

## Changes and improvements

- The VM on Mac and Windows will now use 2GB of RAM by default
  - Anyone who's low on RAM (< 8GB) can use `fin vm ram 1024` to limit the VM memory to 1GB
- Use `nocopy` mode for `project_root` volume
  - This tells Docker to not merge the content of the volume with the destination directory in the container (if one is not empty)
- SSH Agent usage refactoring
  - Removed dependency on the host's `$HOME` directory mount.
- `host_home` volume is deprecated and removed from stack files
  - **This is a breaking change!**
  - See instructions above on the necessary adjustments to `docksal.yml`. 
- Ability to stop at restart certain service container, e.g. `fin restart db`
- Fix mysql import for large database (#279)
  - Database truncation was rewritten. Now database will be dropped and re-created. Should work faster and more reliable.
- Mysql import and dump functions will properly read `MYSQL_DATABASE` environment variable (#276)
- Temporary workaround for NFS issues on Mac (#265)
- Fixed the install/update process handling when Docker is already installed (#298)
- Other fixes and improvements 

## Documentation

- New: [Folder aliases](http://docs.docksal.io/en/v1.4.0/advanced/folder-aliases)

# 1.3.1 (2017-06-02)

## New software versions 
* **fin 1.10.0**

## Fixes and improvements

* Fix retrospective bug that was making `DOCKSAL_DNS2` value empty
* Fix permissions issues on Windows that were related to improper `uid`/`gid`
* Fix edge case with software versions comparison, that prevented software installations in some cases (#224)
* Refactored automatic DNS resolver configuration
  - Doing a DNS probe to make sure the upstream DNS server is reachable
  - Using `8.8.8.8` a the default upstream DNS on all platforms
  - `DOCKSAL_DNS_UPSTREAM` can be used to override the default upstream DNS server
  - Automatic DNS resolver can now be disabled via `DOCKSAL_NO_DNS_RESOLVER=true`
  - Set interface metric on Windows. This makes sure our VBox adapters is the first in the list and thus it's DNS server settings will be used by Windows
  - Adding configure_resolver "off" mode. This will revert resolver settings when the VM is stopped, killed, removed
  - Added a flag to control query logging in `docksal-dns`
  - Updated docs regarding the DNS resolver


# 1.3.0 (2017-05-16)

## New Features

* `*.docksal` domain resolver now works on Windows removing the need to edit the `hosts` file! 
* `fin db <command>` replaces all previously existing mysql related commands (`sqli` is now `db import` etc.). See `fin db help` for details. Old commands still work for compatibility.
* `fin vm hdd` - show VM hdd capacity and usage. `fin vm stats` will only show CPU and network stats now
* `fin hosts` - easily add or remove a host to/from OS-dependent `hosts` file (Relates to #113)
* Override VirtualBox HDD size during VM creation. Set `VBOX_HDD` environment variable to the desired size in megabytes. Default is `50000`. (see https://github.com/docksal/docksal/commit/d50e00367514f64ad0ae4421f6d08cc614d39e2e for details)

## Changes and improvements

* Windows SMB share creation and mount refactoring
    - Prefix Docksal SMB shares with `docksal-` to avoid conflicts with existing shares. Docksal share names on Windows will now look like `\\computer\docksal-c` instead of `\\computer\c` before. Should address file permissions issues some Windows users had had.
    - Domain name is now properly passed during shares mount. Should address share mount issues for domain users.
    - Mount SMB shares with `ntlmssp` or `ntlm` security options. Perform two attempts: use `ntlmssp` by default, use `ntlm` as a fallback. Should address issues for many users of corporate Windows laptops (#117)
    - Perform umount before mount in `smb_share_mount` to simplify debugging (e.g. `fin vm mount` to remount the share)
    - Allow overriding CIFS `sec` option by setting `SEC_SMB` environment variable. Useful for debugging or for edge cases when neither of existing options work. `SMB_SEC=ntlmv2 fin vm mount`. Also see [unix.stackexchange.com/questions/124342](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/124342/mount-error-13-permission-denied/124352#124352)
* Improve messaging to show when database dump is being imported from stdin 
* Fix automatic VirtualBox installation on Windows
* Docksal console desktop icon is deprecated. With the winpty improvements there is no need in this experimental console approach anymore.
* Import SSH keys during containers reset on Linux (#180)
* `vhost-proxy` and `dns` are now binding to `192.168.64.100` on all platforms. This should help to avoid conflicts with local web server instances (assuming they also don't bind to `0.0.0.0`, but use a specific IP instead (e.g. Apache on Linux can now run on `127.0.0.1` in parallel with Docksal)

## Documentation

* How to increase Docksal VirtualBox VM disk size 
* Drush site aliases documentation improvements
* New edge case in Troubleshooting: `FastCGI: incomplete headers`
* Updated "Working with multiple projects/domains"
* Added "Stats and analytics" section


## 1.2.0 (2017-04-12)

### New features

- New one-line installer: `curl -fsSL get.docksal.io | sh`
- Docksal usage stats. Minimal OS/version and fin version tracking via Google Analytics.
- `fin debug` - a new hidden command for debugging purposes

- `fin run-cli` - run a standalone, one-off cli container in the current directory. This allows using any tool inside cli without an already created/running Docksal project/stack.
- `fin image` command to manage images (save, load, view Docksal images on Docker Hub).
  - Adds support for saving and loading Docksal system and project images (e.g. from a local drive).
- Portable installation mode support (e.g. from a USB drive or a local folder)
  - Useful for conferences/trainings/etc. where internet bandwidth is an issue
  - `fin update` - supports VirtualBox, boot2docker.iso and tools (Mac and Windows)
  - `fin vm start` - load system images from a local `docksal-system-images.tar` file
- Magento support and [sample project repos](https://github.com/docksal/magento)

- Soften Docker version requirements - allowing higher Docker versions, since Docker added backward API compatibility.
- `fin cleanup` is now executed on `fin update` to address weird cases when Docker is using outdated image versions. #155
- Added DNS settings for all services. Addresses the issue with containers not being able to resolve `.docksal` domains.
