# Do not mount the project codebase from the host
# An empty project_root volume is created and can be used to store the project codebase inside the Docksal stack.
# Similar to unison, but without the actual sync happening.
# Can be used to provision completely blank environments and have all work (code checkout, etc.) done inside cli.
# Provides THE BEST fs performance.
